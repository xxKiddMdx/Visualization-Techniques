                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The audience is anybody, with any amount of visualization
                    knowledge, reading about the gender pay gap.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                What message and questions does this visualization convey and
                answer?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This visualization asks and answers the question "What does
                    the pay gap look like between men and women in certain
                    occupations?".
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                What data is encoded in the visualization?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The difference in pay between men and women in different
                    occupations is encoded, as well as the salary and number of
                    men/women working in this occupation.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                How does the visualization encode the data?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The visualization uses color to represent men and women. The
                    length channel is used to represent the pay gap. Volume is
                    used to encode number of men and women working in each
                    field, as well as position.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                What tasks readers perform on the visualization ?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Readers can identify which occupations have the largest pay
                    gaps, and look at trends to understand how the pay gap grows
                    when salary rises. Similarly, they can also identify the
                    trend that there is less of a pay gap in female dominated
                    fields.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                How are the five principles applied to this visualization?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Truthfulness is used in this visualization through
                    accurately representing the axes and by having a straight on
                    view, rather than angled down to make the pay gap line
                    appear longer. This is very functional because the way it
                    encodes the data makes the trends very easy to read,
                    supports meaningful tasks, and allows us to answer question
                    about the topic. This graph is beautiful because it is
                    visually aesthetic, is free of unecessary elements, and
                    supports additional subjective goals. This is insightful as
                    well because it informs us about our society. Lastly, this
                    is enlightening because through its interactive abilities,
                    it engages with the audience and conveys a compelling story.

                Considering all aspects, why is this visualization good or bad?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This is a good visualization because it allows viewers to
                    easily grasp trends about the data and topic through
                    functional and beautiful visualization techniques.

                  </li>
                  <li>

                What tasks readers perform on the visualization ?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Readers are able to compare the percentages of different
                    types of food in different periods of time. They can also
                    see the trend by following the words: chicken rises to the
                    top between 2004 and 2019. Although the pounds per capita of
                    beef decreased, beef still makes up a large portion of
                    protein consumption.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                How are the five principles applied to this visualization?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Truthful: By comparing each type of food to the total
                    protein consumption, readers can easily find the trend that
                    more people start to consume chicken. The data itself is
                    also valid since the author mentioned that the source is
                    from the USDA Food Availability Data System.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Functional: The visualization is very understandable and
                    easy to follow. It uses a sentence in the chart to guide the
                    reader to find the key information. The chart also uses the
                    percentage to make it easier for readers to compare.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Beautiful: The color selection of this visualization is very
                    precise and beautiful. All colors are symbolic so that
                    readers can easily associate colors with the actual food.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Insightful: The chart helps me to confirm my belief that
                    beef is very popular in the United States. However, it is
                    surprising to see that chicken is the most popular protein
                    source right now.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Enlightening: It can be helpful for restaurants since they
                    are able to adjust their menus based on the American diet.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    It is a good visualization since it not only provides
                    accurate data but also utilizes an interesting way to
                    interact with readers and track the changes over the years.
                    The result that readers can get from the visualization can
                    be insightful and easy to memorize.

                    are increasing each month. Beatifulness is enhanced through
                    color. This is not very insightful because the reader has a
                    hard time in finding trends/extremes, nor is it enlightening
                    because it doesn't inform readers well or make data more

              Although I don't think this is the best redesign choice here, I
              really like this redesign technique because it is creative and
              something that I haven't seen much before. I it is very similar to
              the bar chart, using length as the main visual encoding, but it
              lays out the bars in a circular fashion. Compared to the original,
              it is different because it uses length as the encoding channel for
              the number of hours (a quantitive measurement), rather than for
              the month which is a categorical/nominal element. Length is used
              as the main source of comparison here, which works very well to
              compare overtime hours. Color/hue could be added to double encode
              this quantitive data. In this specific redesign, I traded
              creativity/beautifulness with readability and functionality,
              because it is harder to determine which month is where due to the
              radial axis of months.

            <p class="redesign-info">
              Much like in redesign 1, I used length to represent the
              quantitative value of number of overtime hours worked, for the
              same reasons as stated for redesign 1. This improves upon the
              original because it is much more functional- the data/trend are
              much easier to read when we encode the quantitative data with
              length becase it is very easy to compare accross. While I think
              this is the most effective redesign because it is the easiest to
              observe trends from and find extremes, it is sort of boring.
              Color/saturation and data labels could be used to add another
              visual encoding channel for the quantiative data to increase the
              beauty of the design.

            <p class="redesign-info">
              This redesign uses position and volume to visually encode the
              number of overtime hours worked. I chose to use both because I
              thought either of these visualization channels on it's own would
              not be readable enough, but with both it adds functionality and
              reiterates the trends. This is very different from the first one
              and adds 2 visual encoding technqiues that were not used before,
              and it switches the x and y axis. This improves upon the original
              because position is a more effective way of encoding quantitative
              data. With just position encoding it, I thought the visualization
              was not beautiful or engaging enough, so I added the volume visual
              channel to add a new level of depth and engagement.

                How are the five principles applied to this visualization?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Truthful: We can not determine the accuracy of the data
                    since the author mentioned that data came from various
                    sources. It’s also hard for readers to verify the accuracy
                    since there is no software that is able to record all the
                    chats.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Functional: The visualization is hard to follow since there
                    are so many divisions in the pie chart, and the lines are
                    too thin that readers need to spend more time connecting the
                    emoji to the corresponding area.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Beautiful: The chart uses random colors to represent emojis,
                    which are not symbolic at all. Also, the author uses the
                    same color more than once, which makes the chart even harder
                    to follow.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Insightful: It does not provide much meaningful information
                    other than telling readers what are the most popular emojis.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Enlightening: The visualization does not show any further
                    effects after knowing the rank.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Considering all aspects, why is this visualization good or bad?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    I think this is a bad visualization because it divides the
                    chart into too many parts and picks colors randomly.
                    Besides, the sources of the data are not authoritative, and
                    the chart itself does not provide much meaningful
                    information.
                  </li>
                </ul>

              I think my first redesign improves the most from the original. By
              using a bar chart instead of a pie chart, the visualization shows
              the ranking more efficiently and directly. In addition, I decided
              to include only the top 8 popular emojis such that readers can
              grasp the most important information in a short time. Most of the
              audience is unwilling to spend much time searching for the
              frequency of a specific emoji that’s not common in use.

              This redesign adjusts the size of emoji based on their percentage.
              Readers can easily find emojis that are the most popular. However,
              it’s hard to compare emojis of similar popularity because they are
              about the same size.
